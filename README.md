### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm an engineer who's primary hobbies are programming for Unity and Dotnet.  I also have interests in SSI and blockchain.  

Several of my most active projects are private due to the fact these are commerical in nature.  For those repos, a public repo with public information may also exist.  And, I will entertain access to the private repos via a signed NDA agreement on an as needed basis. In particular:  
- [Max Capacity](https://github.com/tatmanblue/max-capacity.pub)
- [Pitcairn Island](https://github.com/tatmanblue/Pitcairn-Island.pub)
- Unity projects shared with Max Capacity and Pitcairn Island
- [TatmanGames](https://www.tatmangames.com/) and [personal websites](http://tatmanblue.com/)
  
A lot of the public repos are archives of *very old projects* I no longer work on.  These are uploaded into github for archival purposes only and are marked `archive`.  

Looking forward to hearing from you.   In the mean time, check out my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmvNJdvUxgwUWeNh4nLNoiQ) for video updates.
