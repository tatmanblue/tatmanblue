### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm an engineer who's primary hobbies are programming for Unity and Dotnet.  I also have interests in SSI and blockchain.  

Several of my biggest projects are private due to their commercial nature.  If you wish to discuss these, I am happy to share after the 
appropriate NDA and non-compete agreements are completed.  In the mean time, check out my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmvNJdvUxgwUWeNh4nLNoiQ) for video updates on one [exciting project](https://github.com/tatmanblue/max-capacity.pub) of mine.

Looking forward to hearing from you.
